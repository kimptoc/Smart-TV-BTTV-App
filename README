This is an app to present the podcasts of the Bagel Tech Network (http://www.bageltechnews.com/).

Demo site here:
http://kimptoc.github.com/Smart-TV-BTTV-App/

It just presents a menu of channels and then you can view/stream an episode from a selected channel.

NOTES:
- the mouse clicks seems to work, but dont - so dont use the mouse, use keyboard, eg like remote control

TODO
- when go back to station page video bit still showing, sometimes :(
- should return from station page exit app?
- what does enter key do? disable it? seems to not do anything useful
- rebrand to British Tech News, new logos/titles
- fixed, maybe: whole page is slightly off too high/low... video space is too high, but controls go off bottom of page

TODO LATER
- get BTN page background
- better "loading" animation/intro gifs/video
- refactor layout - put top/bottom in layout, so that minimum in index.html
- reload page now and then to ensure latest shown - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval
- preload episode list for all channels to make channel page quicker

- only works on 2012 samsung, see if can make it work on 2011/2010 models?
