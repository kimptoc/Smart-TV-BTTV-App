This is an app to present the podcasts of the Bagel Tech Network (http://www.bageltechnews.com/).

Demo site here:
http://kimptoc.github.com/Smart-TV-BTTV-App/

It just presents a menu of channels and then you can view/stream an episode from a selected channel.


TODO
- whole page is slightly off too high/low...
- when go back to station page video bit still showing
- keyboard handling - need to switch between station/channel handling
- CSS to highlight currently selected channel on station/home page
- rebrand to British Tech News, new logos/titles

TODO LATER
- get BTN page background
- better "loading" animation/intro gifs/video
- refactor layout - put top/bottom in layout, so that minimum in index.html
- reload page now and then to ensure latest shown - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval

- only works on 2012 samsung, see if can make it work on 2011/2010 models?
