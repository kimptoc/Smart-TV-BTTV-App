This is an app to present the podcasts of the Bagel Tech Network (http://www.bageltechnews.com/).

Demo site here:
http://kimptoc.github.com/Smart-TV-BTTV-App/

It just presents a menu of channels and then you can view/stream an episode from a selected channel.


TODO
- make channel viewing page work, at least on emulator, ideally in browser too
- integrate sample vid code "as is", should mean rss show list will work
- video is slightly off too high/low...
- back button from channel page to station
- CSS to highlight currently selected channel on station/home page
- rebrand to British Tech News, new logos/titles

TODO LATER
- get BTN page background
- better "loading" animation/intro gifs/video
- refactor layout - put top/bottom in layout, so that minimum in index.html
- reload page now and then to ensure latest shown - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval

- only works on 2012 samsung, see if can make it work on 2011/2010 models?
