TODO LATER
- middleman build / not minifying/combining js files...
- use jQuery Deferred's for the async startup stuff, perhaps... or futureJS - https://github.com/coolaj86/futures
- refactor layout - put top/bottom in layout, so that minimum in index.html
- reload page now and then to ensure latest shown - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval

 You can use `do` to wrap the variables:

 for view, url of views
  do (view, url) ->
     console.log "view loading:#{view}/#{url}"
     $.get url, (data) ->
       local_view = view
       console.log "view loaded:#{local_view}", data

or

That's true, then all he needs is to break that out into a function:

loadView = (view, url) ->
   console.log "view loading:#{view}/#{url}"
   $.get url, (data) ->
       console.log "view loaded:#{view}", data

loadView(view, url) for view, url of views

Though it might be better to pass a callback to loadView, so you can
better control the flow, e.g. if you wanted to do them in a series
instead of parallel or even a pool of a maximum number of parallel
calls.
