This is an app to present the podcasts of the British Tech Network (http://www.britishtechnews.com/).

Demo site here:
http://kimptoc.github.com/Smart-TV-BTTV-App/

It just presents a menu of channels and then you can view/stream an episode from a selected channel.

NOTES:
- the mouse clicks seems to work, but dont - so dont use the mouse, use keyboard, eg like remote control

TODO
- consider using gridy to layout available podcasts - http://dailyjs.com/2012/12/10/extender-gridy-reduce/
- enter on episode list goes to full screen, but when play is pressed, screen is not full screen
- should return from station page exit app?
- better format date/time in logging

- fixed? esc/return key on website not returning
- fixed? x / y selected episode, wrap issue when ep >9
- rebrand to British Tech News, new logos/titles
- fixed, i think: when go back to station page video bit still showing, sometimes :(
- fixed, maybe: whole page is slightly off too high/low... video space is too high, but controls go off bottom of page

TODO LATER
- when no episodes returned, still can go up/down, selected episode num changes.. stop that
- autostart first episode on selecting a channel
- Load/structurce css so that its not cached...
- get BTN page background
- better "loading" animation/intro gifs/video
- refactor layout - put top/bottom in layout, so that minimum in index.html
- reload page now and then to ensure latest shown - https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.setInterval
- preload episode list for all channels to make channel page quicker
- return when in full screen, switches to non-full screen (not station listing)
- what does enter key do? disable it? seems to not do anything useful

- only works on 2012 samsung, see if can make it work on 2011/2010 models?

NOTES

- win7 - try and use "Problem Steps Recorder" to record screenshots...

- win7 screen/window capture on MBA
